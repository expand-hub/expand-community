Software is now at the heart of almost every business process. A good digital experience no longer sets you apart from your competitors, it is a prerequisite. 

Software engineering is about so much more than writing code. An excellent product requires lots of disciplines to come together: UX, product design, development, architecture, testing, operations, to name just a few. We believe that the key to creating sustainable software which is not just a joy to use -  but also to make - lies in continuous multidisciplinary collaboration throughout the evolution of the product. Why focus on ‘business & IT alignment’ if instead you can make them both part of the same constantly evolving microorganism!

Expand is a community where we come together and share what we know whilst chasing that elusive ‘engineering culture’. We’re not limited to a single discipline because we believe that we have to look beyond what we know and learn from those around us. We welcome everyone to join, contribute, challenge, ask questions and grow with us. To inspire and get inspired. You can step out of your comfort zone and talk at one of our (virtual) meetups about a topic that you’re passionate about or just listen, learn and reflect. 

At the moment we’re still in the early stages of building our community and we welcome all help and ideas to make it a success.
