### Part I: The Two Systems

**1. The Characters of a Story**  
We have two primary systems for thinking; System 1 operates quickly with no sense of voluntary control, while System 2 deals with effortful mental activity of any kind.

**2. Attention and Effort**  
We avoid cognitive overload by breaking up current tasks into small steps to be committed to long term memory; we are naturally drawn to solutions that use as little mental effort as possible.

**3. The Lazy Controller**  
One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control suggestions from System 1, however it is often lazy and places too much faith in intuition.

**4. The Associative Machine**  
System 1 provides impressions that often turn into beliefs and actions; even the most insignificant of ideas can trigger other ideas and so on.

**5. Cognitive Ease**  
You act differently when experiencing cognitive ease vs. strain; you’ll probably make less errors when strained, but you won’t be as creative.

**6. Norms, Surprises, and Causes**  
The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it.

**7. A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions**  
System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.

**8. How Judgements Happen**  
When making judgements, we often either compute much more information than we need, or we attempt to match the underlying scale of intensity across dimensions.

**9. Answering an Easier Questions**  
If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and answer it instead.


### Part II: Heuristics and Biases

**10. The Law of Small Numbers**  
We have a strong bias towards believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn.

**11. Anchors**  
The anchoring effect occurs when a particular value for an unknown quantity influences your estimate of that quantity.

**12. The Science of Availability**  
The ease with which we can think of examples is often used to judge the frequency of events.

**13. Availability, Emotion, and Risk**  
We try to simplify our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality; in the real world, we often face painful tradeoffs between benefits and costs.

**14. Tom W’s Specialty**  
It’s common practice to overweight evidence and underweight base rates; how do you know that your case is different?

**15. Linda: Less Is More**  
Adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true.

**16. Causes Trump Statistics**  
You’re more likely learn something from an individual case or example than you are from facts and statistics.

**17. Regression to the Mean**  
It’s important to understand the natural fluctuations of quantifiable performance.

**18. Taming Intuitive Predictions**  
In order to produce unbiased predictions, start with the average and systematically move from there based on matching and estimated correlation of evidence.

### Part III: Overconfidence

**19. The Illusion of Understanding**  
We believe that we understand the past due to our constantly adjusting view of the world; this implies that the future should be knowable as well, however we understand the past less than we think.

**20. The Illusion of Validity**  
Subjective confidence isn’t a reasoned evaluation that a judgment is correct, but rather a feeling that reflects the coherence of information and the ease of processing it.

**21. Intuitions vs. Formulas**  
Whenever you can replace intuition and impressions with a structured, yet simple formula, you should at least consider it.

**22. Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?**  
Under normal conditions, you can usually trust an expert’s intuition, however when dealing with less regular environments, be more skeptical.

**23. The Outside View**  
We have a tendency to plan projects based on best-case scenarios and without taking into account all of the previous similar cases out there.

**24. The Engine of Capitalism**  
The suppression of doubt contributes of overconfidence; try using a premortem to legitimize your doubts.

### Part IV: Choices

**25. Bernoulli’s Errors**  
Bernoulli’s expected utility model lacks the idea of a reference point, the value of something is largely dependent on a person’s current situation.

**26. Prospect Theory**  
In mixed gambles, we are naturally risk-averse; while for bad choices, when a sure loss is guaranteed, we are more likely to seek out risk.

**27. The Endowment Effect**  
We naturally assign more value to things just because we own them.

**28. Bad Events**  
We generally work harder to avoid losses than we do to secure gains.

**29. The Fourfold Pattern**  
Humans are just as risk seeking in the domain of losses as we are risk averse in the domain of gains.

**30. Rare Events**  
People often overestimate the probabilities of unlikely events; this causes us to overweight them in our decisions.

**31. Risk Policies**  
In order to avoid exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion, take a broad frame; think as if the decision is just one of many.

**32. Keeping Score**  
Rewards and punishments shape our preferences and motivate our actions, all kept track of by difference mental accounts.

**33. Reversals**  
Single evaluations call upon the emotional responses of System 1, whereas comparisons involve more careful assessment, typically by System 2.

**34. Frames and Reality**  
Logically different statements can evoke different reactions depending on how they are framed.

### Part V: Two Selves

**35. Two Selves**  
We have an experiencing self and a remembering self; the latter of which keeps score and governs what we learn in order to make decisions.

**36. Life as a Story**  
Most people are indifferent to their experiencing self, only caring about the memories collected in order to fuel different narratives.

**37. Experienced Well-Being**  
People’s evaluations of their lives and their actual experience are related, but different.

**38. Thinking About Life**  
The word happiness doesn’t have a simple meaning and should not be used as if it does.
