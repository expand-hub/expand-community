Many communities focus on a single topic. Development, software architecture, testing, operations, user experience, product design, etc. EXPAND is here to change that, because we believe that to make sustainable software that brings value, we need to look beyond what we know and learn from those around us.

EXPAND brings together every IT discipline, for an in-depth look at the value and difference every role brings. We will be learning new ways of working together and sharing our knowledge, with a focus on mastery in engineering teams.
